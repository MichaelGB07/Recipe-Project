        <h1> Fu-Fu Recipe </h1>
        <img src="../food-img/fu-fu.jpg"width="400px" height="300px">
        <h2> Description </h2>
            <p> Portuguese traders from <strong>Brazil</strong> introduced fufu to Africa and when it landed in 
                Ghana, ancestors named it 'fufuo'. They mixed the fermented cassava with plantain 
                and pounded it to get a sticky mixture. Since then, they passed this lesson from 
                generation to generation. Ideally, <em>'fufu'</em> loosely translates to a mashed mix.</p>
        <h2> Ingredients </h2>  
            <ul>
                <li> 2 Pounds Yams </li>
                <li> Kosher Salt, To Taste </li>
                <li> Freshly Ground Black Pepper, To Taste </li>
                <li> One Teaspoon Olive Oil </li>
            </ul>
        <h2> Steps </h2>    
            <ol>
                <li> Gather the Ingredients </li>
                <li> Carefully peel the Yams </li>
                <li> Cut the peeled yams into 2-inch chunks and place them in a large pot of well 
                    salted water</li>
                <li> Bring the yams to a boil over high heat. Keep a rapid boil until the yams 
                    are just turning soft, about 20 minutes </li>
                <li> Drain the yams, reserving 2 cups of the cooking water. Allow the yams to cool </li>
                <li> Place the cooled yams in a large bowl along with salt and pepper to taste, and the olive oil </li>
                <li> Mash and mix the ingredients using a potato masher. The mixture will be uneven and lumpy </li>
                <li> Place the fufu mixture in a food processor or blender. Pulse briefly at low speed to 
                    remove any lumps but do not puree </li>
                <li> Place the yam mixture back in the bowl and beat it with a wooden spoon until it becomes 
                    smooth. The mixture should become sticky and slightly elastic </li>
                <li> Shape the fufu into balls of equal size and serve as an accompaniment to your favorite soup or stew </li>
            </ol>
